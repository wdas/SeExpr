# Texture Tiler

# Adrienne Othon  Dec 23, 2004

# A user specified texture is mapped within each grid cell.
# It's the user's job to provide a texture that is tileable 
# for the results to look good.  The grid may be scaled and/or
# rotated.
# The pattern generated is projected along x axis onto the model.




#------------------------------------------------------
# grid xform params:
$scale = 1;    #size of the grid
$scaley = 1;     #scale the grid along y (vertical)
$scalez = 1;     #scale the grid along z (horizontal)
$angle = 0.000;   #0.0,360.0 degrees

#scale (size) of the texture.  compute coordinate within this cell
$scaletex = 1;
$scaletexy = 1;
$scaletexz = 1;
$jitter = 0;

$translatey = 0;  #-5.0,5.0
