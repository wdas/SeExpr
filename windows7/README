Because there are some known problems with building bison/flex files 
on Windows, this directory contains needed files built on Linux that 
work with a Windows 7 / Visual Studio 2010 build.  

Copy the files in SeExpr/generated/* and SeExprEditor/generated/* to 
their respective src sub-directories.

Here is a tree listing of what's in this sub-directory:

windows7/
├── README
├── SeExpr
│   └── generated
│       ├── SeExprParser.cpp
│       ├── SeExprParserLex.cpp
│       └── SeExprParser.tab.h
└── SeExprEditor
    └── generated
        ├── SeExprSpecParser.cpp
        ├── SeExprSpecParserLex.cpp
        └── SeExprSpecParser.tab.h
